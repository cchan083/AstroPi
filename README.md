# AstroPi
In this project, our group will be trying to estimate the velocity of the ISS, using computer vision 


Improving our program:
Use a different feature detection algorithm in OpenCV
Choose a different number of feature matches to use
Use more than two photos
Check how long a photo takes to be written to disk to get a more accurate value for the time between photos
Does the curvature of the Earth have an effect on the actual distance values travelled?
Does the height of the identified feature also have an effect?
Does the angle of motion (diagonally across the frame) have a impact that needs to be corrected for?
â€“ If your matched features are clouds, can you compensate for the fact that they may be moving too?
