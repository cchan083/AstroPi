Requirements: General

Your program does not rely on interaction with an astronaut. ✅

Your program is written in Python 3.11 and is named main.py, and it runs without errors when tested with the Astro Pi Replay Tool using python3 main.py. ✅

Your program does not rely on any additional libraries other than those listed in the Mission Space Lab creator guide (rpf.io/msl-creators).  ```Micropip library?```


Your program monitors its running time and stops after 10 minutes have elapsed. ```Not yet```

There is no bad language, rudeness, or political statements in your program. ✅

Your program uses at least one Sense HAT sensor or the camera.✅

Your program is uploaded in a zip file. If you have additional files that are required for the operation of your experiment, they can be included in the zip file too, but the zip file must contain a file called main.py, which must be how your program is run. ✅

Your program does not use the Astro Pi’s LED matrix.✅

Your program does not display flags during its run.✅

Your program is not allowed to retain more than 42 images at the end of the 10 minutes — though it can store more than that while it is running.✅

Your zipped program must not be more than 3MB, unless it includes a TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) machine learning model, in which case your zipped program must not be more than 7MB.✅

Requirements: Security

Your program is well documented and easy to understand, and there is no attempt to hide or obfuscate what a piece of code does. ``double check```

Your program does not start a system process, or run another program or any command usually entered on the terminal (e.g. vcgencmd). ✅

Your program does not use networking. ✅

Your program does not include malicious code (i.e. code that deliberately attempts to disrupt system functionality).✅

Requirements: Files and threads

Your program does not use threads, or if it does, it does so only by using the threading library; threads are managed carefully and closed cleanly, and their use is clearly explained through comments in the code.✅

Your program only saves data in the same folder where your main Python file is, as described in the Mission Space Lab creator guide (i.e. using the special __file__ variable); your program does not attempt to create new directories for storing your data, and no absolute path names are used. ```Double check this as it creates a data folder```

Your program runs without errors and does not raise any unhandled exceptions. ```double check```

Any files that your program creates have names that only include letters, numbers, dots (.), dashes (-), or underscores (_).✅

Your program does not use more than 250MB of space to store data. ✅

As well as containing your main.py file, the zip file that you submit must only contain the following file types: .py, .main, .csv, .txt, .jpg, .png, .yuv, .json, .toml, .yaml, .tflite. ✅

In addition to your result.txt file, the output of your program must only include the following file types: .csv, .txt, .log, .jpg, .png, .yuv, .raw (camera), .h264, .json, .toml, .yaml. ✅

Programs that do not respect this checklist will be disqualified.
